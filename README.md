# EECS118_Deep_Learning
Implement a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model which is trained among handwritten digit data and use the trained neural network to classify test data. 
Used Keras, a high-level neural network API to implement a CNN. By changing the activation functions, number of layers, number of filters, 
one can tune the model to achieve the best prediction accuracy among the testing data.
